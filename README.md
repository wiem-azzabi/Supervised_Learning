# this projects contains two notebooks written in Python using SickitLearn library and Pandas DataFrames: 
# 1 - Data preprocessing and analysing
# 2 - Supervised machine learning models ( Linear Regression , KNN , SVR , MLP , Decision Tree , Random Forest..) on which applied GridSearchCV algorithm to get the best parameters for the model.
